# Water-level-controller

A system is made using 8051 microcontroller which displays the level of water in the tank and automatically switches off the motor when the water level reaches maximum.
I/P side: First looking at the input side 4 push buttons are used to represent differet water levels, in practical application a simple wire can be used and placed at different levels in the tank.
O/P: On the output side a motor is interfaced with the microcontroller which stays ON till the top most switch is closed, i.e. as soon as the top most switch is closed the motor is turned OFF.
The LCD screen displays the water level in the tank and also a set of LEDs are used to indicate water level, 4 different color LEDs are used to indicate 4 different water level. The LEDs are optional since we already have LCD display to show us the water level.
We can make modifications such as increase the water levels so that we can get more control of amount of water in the tank.
